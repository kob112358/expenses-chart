This was another fun little project to practice my css/html/react components. I know I still have a lot to learn, but this one did go much quicker than my previouis component I built. As they say, practice make perfect. 

Things to work on:

-Understanding position a bit better and when to use it

-Continue working on using relative units instead of hard coded measurements.
